<p>In this project, We will create a printf function that can output formatted text to the console. printf is a very powerful function that can format text in many ways. It is a core function of the C standard library, And almost every C program uses it at some point. Our goal is to create a custom version of this function</p>

<p>To create our custom printf function, We need to plan out how it will work. We can create a flowchart to help us visualize the logic of the function. Here is an example of a simple flowchart for printf:</p>

<p>start -> read format string -> while format string not empty -></p>
<p>parse next format specifier -> output text before specifier -></p>
<p>if specifier is %d -> output decimal number</p>
<p>if specifier is %s -> output string</p>
<p>if specifier is %c -> output character</p>
<p>if specifier is %% -> output %</p>
<p>if specifier is unknown -> output error</p>
<p>end loop -> output remaining text -> end</p>

<p>In this project, we will use our knowledge of C and the concepts of pair programming, flowcharts, and technical writing to create a custom printf function. We will work together as a team to write high-quality code and documentation. By the end of the project, we will have a better understanding of how printf works and how to create our own custom functions in C.</p>
